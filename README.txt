 =====================================

RedMan is a multi-leveled platformer game with varied and interesting levels.

Some of the code needs rewriting to make things a little neater which I hope to get round to soon.

If you enjoyed this code you can check out my website at http://www.benhomer.freeiz.com/blog where you can download an executable version of the game.

Note: Typewriter.cs, RectangleExtensions.cs and RotatedRectangle.cs were borrowed from other sources online.
